# Setup Consul and Nomad with TLS and Transparent Proxy
Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Google API Key with access to Google Gemini LLM model
- Weather API Key (visit https://www.weatherapi.com/)

```bash
# preparing secrets
touch .env
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>" >> .env
echo "WEATHER_API_KEY=<your_weather_api_key>" >> .env
echo "CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=e95b599e-166e-7d80-08ad-aee76e7ddf19" >> .env

# aws account secrets

# creating the Nomad and Consul cluster
./apply.sh

# keep output for above command
ssh_to_client_service = <<EOT
ssh_to_client_service:
ssh -i "minion-key.pem" ubuntu@3.110.125.150
ssh -i "minion-key.pem" ubuntu@13.203.43.193

consul_ui_url

**Launch the CLI (cmd.py)**
python3 -m app.cmd.cmd --agent http://3.110.125.150:10002
python3 -m app.cmd.cmd --agent http://13.203.43.193:10002


EOT
```

Yay! We have successfully created a Consul and Nomad cluster with TLS and Transparent Proxy enabled.

# Uploading Python application to Nodes

```bash
./patch-ai-new.bash
```

# create consul intentions using UI
Note use Consul URL and Token from the output of `apply.sh`
```
All Services -> All Services DENY
or
consul intention create -deny '*' '*'
```

# Deploying jobs to Nomad
Note Nomad UI URL and Token from the output of `apply.sh`
```bash
In directory `./shared/nomad`, run all the jobs using Nomad UI
```

# Client CLI
```bash
# Environment setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .

# Running the Client CLI
python3 -m app.cmd.cmd --agent http://*.*.*.*:10002 # as mentioned in the output of `apply.sh`
```

# Testing Prompts
Try following prompts in the above CLI:
```txt
Q: How is the weather in Paris?
Agent says: I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. I do not have access to real-time information, such as weather forecasts.  To get the current weather in Paris, you will need to use a weather website or app.

Q: Exchange rate of USD to INR?
Agent says: I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. I do not have access to real-time information, such as current exchange rates.  To get the current USD to INR exchange rate, you will need to use a financial website or app that provides live currency data.
```

## Add Consul Service intentions
Add Consul intentions to allow communication between services
```bash
consul intention create -allow host-agent-app weather-agent-app
```

Try the above prompts again in same CLI:
```txt
Q: How is the weather in Paris?
Agent says: The weather in Paris is currently moderate rain, with a temperature of 20.3째C (68.5째F), 83% humidity, and a 12.3 mph wind blowing from the West.

Q: Exchange rate of USD to INR?
Agent says: I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. I do not have access to real-time information, such as current exchange rates.  To get the current USD to INR exchange rate, you will need to use a financial website or app that provides live currency data.
```

Add other Consul intentions to allow communication between other agent and MCPs
```bash
consul intention create -allow host-agent-app travel-agent-app
consul intention create -allow travel-agent-app currency-converter-mcp
```

Try the above prompts again in same CLI:
```txt
Q: How is the weather in Paris?
Agent says: The weather in Paris is currently moderate rain, with a temperature of 20.3째C (68.5째F), 83% humidity, and a 12.3 mph wind blowing from the West.

Q: Exchange rate of USD to INR?
Agent says: The current exchange rate for USD to INR is 86.14.  This data is from 2025-07-18. To get the current USD to INR exchange rate, you will need to use a financial website or app that provides live currency data.

# Part 3: Consul Integration

The setup is composed of:
`api-gw->service-hello` -> 
`service-hello-proxy` -> 
`service-response-proxy` ->
`service-response`

**Run following command**
```bash
cd ./3-consul-service-mesh-simple

terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=variables.hcl
```

Copy the env section from terraform output and execute in terminal
```bash
